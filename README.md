# CodeChum Backend

**Project Overview:**

CodeChum Backend is a personal project designed to complement the original [CodeChum](https://codechum.com/) by providing a robust backend service. Built as a fun challenge, this project aims to replicate the backend functionality of CodeChum, facilitating coding challenges and enhancing my programming skills. This backend works in conjunction with the [CodeShum](https://github.com/kintoyyy/codeshum) frontend.

**Features:**

- **API for Challenges:** Access a variety of coding challenges through a RESTful API, categorized by difficulty and topic.
- **Real-time Terminal:** Use WebSocket to create a live terminal experience, allowing users to run code and receive instant feedback.
- **User Management:** Implement user authentication and profile management to track progress and achievements.
- **Data Persistence:** Store user data and challenge information in MongoDB for reliable data management.

**Technologies Used:**

- Backend: Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Real-time Communication: WebSocket
