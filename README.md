# CodeChum Backend

**Project Overview:**

CodeChum Backend was a personal project designed to complement the original [CodeChum](https://codechum.com/) by providing a robust backend service. Built as a fun challenge, this project aimed to replicate the backend functionality of CodeChum, facilitating coding challenges and enhancing my programming skills. This backend was designed to work in conjunction with the [CodeShum](https://github.com/kintoyyy/codeshum) frontend.
